## Inspiration
The **Wood County Child Protection Board's mission** includes protecting, assisting, and encouraging foster children in Wood County, Texas 
by providing essential items and experiences that foster a sense of normalcy during difficult times.

However, going through the accounting process, as a nonprofit, is not sustainable, as the software they were using, QuickBooks, costs $1,200+ 
annually for just one user. On top of that, the software is too complex for nonprofits, as they only need basic financial tools.

Our goal was to create a basic accounting software that had the following features:
- **Fund Accounting**: categorizing and tracking restricted vs. unrestricted funds
- **Grant Tracking**: tracking allocation and compliance for grant funds
- **Donor Management**: keep track of donors, donor receipts, and donation details for tax reporting
- **Budgeting**: sets up and monitors budgets for different programs or funds
- **Creating Reports**: creating reports such as a balance sheet, which would be a snapshot of the nonprofit's financial condition, an income statement, which is a statement of activities, and donor receipts and acknowledgements
- **IRS Filings**: filing away IRS tax forms all in one secure place
